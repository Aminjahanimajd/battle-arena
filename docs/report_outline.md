# Report Outline (to be filled with code excerpts)

1. Introduction & Motivation
2. Requirements & Constraints
3. Methodology (Booch) — objects, semantics, relationships, implementation
4. Architecture — packages and layering
5. OOP Concepts (each section with code example):
   - Encapsulation & Information Hiding
   - Access Modifiers
   - Abstraction
   - Inheritance & Subtyping
   - Polymorphism (inclusion/overriding; ad-hoc/overloading; parametric)
   - Composition vs Inheritance (reuse)
   - Delegation
   - Exception Handling
6. Modularity (5 criteria & 5 rules) + SOLID — mapping to code
7. Design Patterns used (Template Method, Strategy/Command, etc.)
8. Testing Strategy
9. User Guide (CLI, later GUI)
10. Future Work (skills, items, terrain, JavaFX)
