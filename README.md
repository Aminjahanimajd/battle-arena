# Battle Arena ðŸŽ®

A Java-based **turn-based strategy game** implemented with strong **OOP principles**.

## Features (planned)
- Human vs Computer battle system
- Multiple character classes (Warrior, Mage, Archer)
- Turn-based combat with attacks and abilities
- GUI (2D/2.5D)

## OOP Methodology
This project follows the **Booch methodology** for object-oriented design:
- Identify objects
- Define semantics (behavior)
- Define relationships (specialization, grouping, composition)
- Implement objects

We also apply:
- **SOLID principles**
- **Program to Interface, not Implementation**
- **Reuse mechanisms** (Composition > Inheritance, Delegation, Parametrized types)
- **Parnas principles** for information hiding

## Structure
- `core/`: Game engine & rules
- `entities/`: Characters & players
- `mechanics/`: Battle mechanics (attacks, abilities, damage)
- `utils/`: Helpers, configs, dice rolls

## Build & Run
1. Open in **VS Code** or NetBeans.
2. Compile and run `Main.java`.
